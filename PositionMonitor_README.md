The PositionMonitor solution contains various projects to aid in managing
positions.

## Projects

A description of each project.

### PositionMonitor (GUI)

Desktop application deployed to director's PC. This desktop 
application interacts with a generic WebSockets API (WebSocketAlertFoundations).

Refer to Readme within PositionMonitor folder for further documentation.

### PositionMonitor.Datafeed.IosPlus

Extracts trades and orders from Iress via IOS+ to generate a list of open positions, closed positions, and open orders. This information is presented in the PositionMonitor GUI and parts of the data is displayed in most of the tradingtools.

Refer to Readme within PositionMonitor.Datafeed.IosPlus folder for further documentation.

### PositionMonitor.Datafeed.Ios - _Deprecated. IosPlus is now in Production and contains additional features._

Throughout documentation on this has been skipped. It is very similar to IosPlus, however it is unable to see orders placed via IosPlus.

### PositionMonitor.AccountPositions.X

Gathers positions from broker X and persists these to the {env}-positions table. This information is used to generate a daily positions report at midday.

The positions report is generated by a Lambda function residing in the `PositionMonitor.AccountPositions.Le/cloudformation` folder.
