Refer to Readme within PositionMonitor folder for further documentation.

### PositionMonitor.Datafeed.IosPlus

Extracts trades and orders from Iress via IOS+ to generate a list of open positions, closed positions, and open orders. This information is presented in the PositionMonitor GUI and parts of the data is displayed in most of the tradingtools.

### PositionMonitor.Datafeed.Ios - _Deprecated. IosPlus is now in Production and contains additional features._

### PositionMonitor.AccountPositions.X

The positions report is generated by a Lambda function residing in the `PositionMonitor.AccountPositions.Le/cloudformation` folder.
