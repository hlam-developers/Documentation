### NewsAlerts.Datafeed

Responsible for extracting news from Iress and persisting this to the DynamoDB
table {env}-news-library.

Please refer to the `cloudformation` folder within this project, as this folder contains
additional serverless projects and readmes.

### NewsLibrary.Tokeniser

Note that this serverless project is not contained within this repository, however it's
kept here for reference as it's an important piece of the puzzle.

The purpose of this project is to tokenise each article as it comes through,
preparing it for later correlation by the NewsLibrary.Processor project 
defined below.

In hindsight this project name is now misleading - as there's two projects called
news library "processor":

### NewsLibrary.Processor

Responsible for processing tokenised articles (refer to NewsLibrary.Tokeniser above) 
and drawing correlations between companies.

This data is currently only displayed in the News Gathering Tool, but may serve another
purpose in the future.

This runs on an EC2 instance and is a nightly process.
